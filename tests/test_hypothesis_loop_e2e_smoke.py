"""Phase 9: end-to-end smoke for the hypothesis refinement loop.

Simulates the full discipline lifecycle without a running scheduler:
  1. Cap pressure valve: with cap=3, a fourth create_hypothesis evicts the
     weakest active instead of refusing.
  2. Round-robin: under min_per_pick=2, the promotion loop distributes
     dispatches in chunks instead of bingeing on one hypothesis.
  3. Verdict floor: a hypothesis with strong children → 'proven', graduates.
  4. Pool frees: graduation moves the hypothesis to manager_state='graduated'
     and lets create_hypothesis admit a new one without eviction.
  5. Revisit: forcing revisit pulls the graduated hypothesis back to active,
     evicting the weakest if the pool is at cap.
