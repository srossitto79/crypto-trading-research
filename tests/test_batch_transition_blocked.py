"""Regression tests for the /api/strategies/batch-transition endpoint.

`transition_stage` does NOT raise when a move is *blocked* (WIP cap full,
operator approval required, gate failure, …). It returns a dict whose
"blocked_reason" key is set. The batch endpoint must classify those as
failures rather than silently reporting them as successfully transitioned.
A success or a no-op (already in the target stage / already archived) has no
"blocked_reason" and must report success.
