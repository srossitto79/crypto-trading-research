"""Self-healing workflow backfill across the whole pre-paper set (2026-06-14).

The backfill used to cover only quick_screen stage and only the
"no current-version workflow" case. So a strategy DEMOTED back from paper to
gauntlet (whose passing workflow is now a terminal dead end) sat stranded — the
step-loop had nothing to drive and it never re-ran. Now the backfill covers
gauntlet too, and resets a terminal current-version workflow in place.
