"""Agent runner — executes agent loops and task processing.

Each agent runs its own loop, picks up tasks assigned by the Brain,
processes them, and returns output to the Brain for review.

The runner implements a tool-call loop: AI requests a tool -> execute it ->
feed the result back -> AI continues until it produces a final answer.
