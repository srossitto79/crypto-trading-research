"""Built-in bot templates for Bot Factory.

Templates are honest about what the engine actually does: each bot sees 1-hour
OHLCV candles for its watched pairs and decides BUY/SELL/SHORT/COVER/HOLD/OBSERVE.
There is no web/news browsing and no multi-timeframe data, so template prose must
not promise either. Templates intentionally omit `model` so an applied bot
inherits the operator's configured default provider (works without an OpenAI key).
