Admin-initiated. Does not run automatically on boot.

Phase 4 of the hypothesis-refinement-loop redesign removed the time-based
auto-disprove rule (Phase Y "no attempts in 14 days"): age alone is no longer
evidence of disproof. The active-pool cap and round-robin depth gate now
prevent the unbounded-pool problem that auto-disprove was patching over.
