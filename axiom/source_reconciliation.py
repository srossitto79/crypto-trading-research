"""Out-of-band source reconciliation: pre-compute cross-venue price divergence.

The promotion gate (``Axiom.policy.evaluate_promotion``) must never fetch market
data or write: ``transition_stage`` runs it while deliberately holding its
connection read-only (the first write is deferred until every gate passes — see
``brain.py:1181-1188``), so a blocking call reachable from the gate would
self-deadlock against that deferred writer for the full busy-timeout. The gate
therefore reads a *pre-computed* divergence metric, and this module is what
computes it — out of band, on a scheduler timer — where fetching is free.

For each capital-bearing strategy's ``(symbol, timeframe)`` it compares the stored
backtest series — the source the strategy was VALIDATED on (Binance parquet) — with
the live trade venue (HyperLiquid) on overlapping closed bars, and persists the
result to KV under ``Axiom:data:divergence:{SYMBOL}:{TIMEFRAME}``. The gate later
reads that key cache-only and refuses promotion when the venues diverge beyond the
operator's threshold (a strategy that backtested on a price series materially
different from the one it will trade on is not trustworthy with capital).

Everything here is best-effort: a single symbol's fetch failure never aborts the
sweep, and a momentary KV lock is swallowed (the value simply refreshes next run).
