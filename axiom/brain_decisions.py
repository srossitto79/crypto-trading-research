"""Phase 1 (P1-T06) — brain_decisions write helpers.

A ``brain_decisions`` row records: the situation the Brain saw, the structured
decision it returned, the actions actually executed, and the prompt cache
hash that produced it. ``outcome_observed`` and ``outcome_at`` start NULL and
are backfilled by P1-T07 when downstream lifecycle events resolve.

Foreign-key linkage: every ``agent_tasks`` row created by a decision's
actions carries ``brain_decision_id = <decision_id>`` so we can join the
audit trail later (decision → tasks → outcomes).
