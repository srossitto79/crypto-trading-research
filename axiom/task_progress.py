"""Task checkpointing for resumable long-running agent tasks.

Some agent tasks (large backtest sweeps, multi-symbol research passes, the
crucible planner) can run for many minutes. If the user closes the Tauri
window mid-task — or the app crashes — we don't want to start over from
scratch on the next open.

Pattern:
    1. The agent code calls ``checkpoint(task_id, key, payload)`` periodically
       to persist progress under a stable key (e.g. ``"symbols_processed"``).
    2. On retry, the agent calls ``read_checkpoint(task_id, key)`` first to
       resume from the most recent payload.
    3. The graceful-shutdown hook (T09) flips status from ``running`` →
       ``interrupted`` for any tasks that were live when the process exited.
    4. ``list_resumable_tasks()`` exposes those interrupted tasks to the UI
       and to the doctor CLI so they can be re-queued.

Stored in the ``task_checkpoints`` table (added in T01 schema migration).
Payload is JSON — don't put large blobs in here, store filesystem refs.
