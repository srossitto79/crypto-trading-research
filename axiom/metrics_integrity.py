"""Data-quality invariants for backtest metrics.

These checks detect metric payloads that are *implausible* rather than merely
bad — the signature of an engine or data bug, not a weak strategy. The
canonical example is the 2026-06 dropna regression: sparse funding/OI columns
silently evicted the entire in-sample window, so ~680 strategies were
auto-rejected on "0 in-sample trades" while their out-of-sample legs traded
actively. Nothing in the pipeline noticed for 13 days because the gates
consumed the zeros as legitimate failures.

Anomalous metrics must be quarantined for investigation — flagged, alerted,
and held out of gate evaluation — never treated as a normal rejection or
allowed to terminally retire a strategy.
