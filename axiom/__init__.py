    The `ta` library (https://github.com/bukosabino/ta) is permanently banned

    ~150 strategy files silently depending on it produced fake "successful"
    backtests for months.

    This tripwire runs at `axiom` package import time and installs a
    `MetaPathFinder` that blocks any attempt to import `ta` or its submodules.
    The error message points at the banned-imports guidance so anyone hitting
    it (human or LLM) knows what to do instead.

    The tripwire is intentionally run unconditionally — even if the real `ta`
    package is installed on the machine (e.g. as a transitive dep of something
    else), attempts to import it from within Axiom code will fail loudly.
