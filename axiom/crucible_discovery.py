"""Autonomous crucible discovery.

Dispatches a benchmarking research task that harvests NEW crucibles from external
sources (YouTube / Reddit / forums / blogs / podcasts / github). It reuses the
benchmarking research_contract so the discover_*/inspect_* tools are actually
reachable for the dispatched task (without a contract the runner defaults to the
exploration lane and those tools hard-reject).

Gated by the ``autonomous_discovery`` setting (default OFF = operator-approves).
This module only creates the work item; the agent's harvesting behaviour and the
disposition of discovered crucibles (review vs auto-advance) are governed by the
mode it stamps on the task.
