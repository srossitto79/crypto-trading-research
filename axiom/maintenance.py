"""Database maintenance: retention pruning + WAL checkpoint + VACUUM.

The Axiom DB grows unbounded — backtest_results (~133K rows / ~940MB),
activity_log (~555K rows), scanner_signal_results and gate_rejections all
accumulate forever. A large single-writer WAL DB amplifies lock contention,
which silently drops the best-effort heartbeats/state writes and makes the
autonomous loop *look* dead. These helpers prune aged rows in bounded batches
(each its own short write txn so they never hold the write lock long), then
checkpoint the WAL. Retention windows are operator-configurable via the
pipeline settings (see ``RETENTION_SETTING_KEYS``) so nothing is hardcoded.

VACUUM (which rewrites the whole file and takes an exclusive lock) is opt-in
and not run on the routine schedule, since locking a multi-GB DB while the app
is live would stall it. Pruning alone frees pages for reuse and bounds growth;
run :func:`vacuum_db` manually to reclaim file size after a large prune.
