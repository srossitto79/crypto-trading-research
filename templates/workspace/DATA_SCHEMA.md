# Data Schema

This document describes every column that may appear on the backtest / scanner
DataFrame. It is injected into every worker agent's context.

**Critical rule — always guard column access:**
```python
if 'col' in df.columns:
    ...
```
Columns vary by asset, timeframe, and backtest window. Never assume a column is
present unless you check. Tier B columns are absent on any backtest window that
predates December 2025.

## Dynamic Column Availability Note

At strategy-generation time you will receive a **"## LAN Metrics Available for This Backtest"**
section listing the exact columns confirmed present for the target asset and
expected backtest window. Use that list — not this schema — to decide which
Tier B columns to reference in your hypothesis code.

When no such section appears, assume only Tier A columns are available.
