		shortDescription: 'Risk-adjusted return measuring excess return per unit of volatility.',
		category: 'metric',
		fullDescription: `The Sharpe Ratio, developed by Nobel laureate William Sharpe in 1966, is the most widely used measure of risk-adjusted returns. It quantifies how much excess return you receive for the extra volatility you endure holding a riskier asset.

A higher Sharpe Ratio indicates better risk-adjusted performance. The ratio essentially answers: "Is this strategy's return worth the risk taken to achieve it?"

The key insight is that raw returns are meaningless without context. A 50% return sounds great, but not if the strategy experienced 80% drawdowns to achieve it. The Sharpe Ratio normalizes returns by their volatility, enabling fair comparison across different strategies and timeframes.`,

Common methods for time series:

**Rolling Window**: Fixed-size training window moves forward through time. Most realistic as it mimics limited memory / look-back constraint of live trading.

**Expanding Window**: Training set grows with each fold. Uses all available prior data. May capture more patterns but assumes stationarity.

**Anchored**: Training always starts from the same point but end expands. Good for capturing long-term patterns while testing recency.

Unlike standard ML cross-validation (like k-fold), time-series CV must respect temporal order - you cannot train on future data.`,
